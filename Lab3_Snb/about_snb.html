<h2>About Us</h2>
	
	<div class="firstDiv">
		<p>Established in 2004, Tom N Toms was founded in South Korea as a way to introduce coffee into a culture 
            that was unfamiliar with the trend of coffee at the time. TNT started a movement into Korea first 24-
            hour coffee service, and from there, introduced the first coffee roastery that provides fresh coffee 
            beans, with the taste and quality that is unprecedented until this day. Since its establishment, TNT 
            has received national and international recognition for its services and products. And, as a result, 
            has expanded all across Korea and globally, resulting in more than 500 locations worldwide. These 
            locations include Singapore, Mongolia, China, Thailand/Myanmar, Philippines, Australia, Malaysia, 
            Qatar, and the United States. TNT endless growth into the coffee market has allowed Korea to further 
            develop its coffee culture in unique ways. However, TNT remains at the forefront of Korea coffee 
            culture, as it continues to grow today.
            <br>
            <br>
            In 2010, TNT opened its first US location, while opening its 200th local location in Korea. And, in 2017,
             TNT was awarded second place in Customer Satisfaction of Coffee Brand (Korea Consumer Agency). And now 
             in 2019, we introduce TNT first Houston, Texas location which is at the heart of Houston Chinatown area.
